### Introduction

This application was created as an Intranet application
using the Blazor Server app and Windows Identity. This
application resides on an internal server, using the
database to verify authorization for the Windows
Identity user to against the database so only users
that reside in the "Employees" table may use the
application.

I originally created this application for the company
